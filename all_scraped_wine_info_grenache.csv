The flavors are rich in cherries, the tannins are thick but fine, and the wine is very dry. It has an attractive suppleness that feels good on the palate.",Bush Vine,Negociants USA–The Winebow Group,Yalumba 2000 Bush Vine Grenache (Barossa Valley),$16, South Australia,87,Barossa Valley,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,,Not rated yet [Add Your Review],Grenache,2000,Yalumba
1655,N/A,"Catalonia, Catalonia, Spain",750 ml,Red, Spain,11/1/2002,"The Best Buy of the year? The price is unbelievable for what you get: bright, crunchy Grenache fruit that overflows the glass with ripe cherries, capped off by a hint of white pepper on the finish. It's fresh, it's bouncy and it's a bit rambunctious in its exuberant youth—perfect with assertively seasoned hamburgers or meatloaf.",Old Vines,Jorge Ordóñez Selections,Viña Alarba 2001 Old Vines Grenache (Catalonia),$6, Catalonia,88,Catalonia,Joe Czerwinski,,,Not rated yet [Add Your Review],Grenache,2001,Viña Alarba
1656,13%,"Priorat, Catalonia, Spain",750ML,Red, Spain,11/1/2002,"Sweet is the best way to describe the nose, which pushes heavy doses of maple and molasses. The palate's black cherry flavors are clean and forward, but all in all this wine suffers from too much driving acidity.

1657,14.5%,"Barossa Valley, South Australia, Australia",750ML,Red, Australia,9/1/2002,"Like many Aussie Grenaches, this is a soft, forward wine that's made for early consumption. But the alcohol is in balance with the juicy cherry fruit and the oak is well integrated, adding dried spices and a hint of chocolate without becoming overpowering. —J.C.",Old Vine,"Southern Starz, Inc",Ross Estate 1999 Old Vine Grenache (Barossa Valley),$18, South Australia,89,Barossa Valley,Joe Czerwinski,,,Not rated yet [Add Your Review],Grenache,1999,Ross Estate
1658,13.8%,"Barossa Valley, South Australia, Australia",750ML,Red, Australia,9/1/2002,"Rich and intense but also round and soft.

1659,14.5%,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",750ML,Red, Australia,9/1/2002,"A soft, round wine that almost seems designed for glugging. Dusty earth and dried grass aromas give way to a sweet, alcoholic attack filled with red berries and cherries.

1660,14%,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",750ML,Red, Australia,9/1/2002,"Aptly named, for the oak influence here is strong—a dusty woodiness that's almost cedary.

1662,13%,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",750ML,Red, Australia,9/1/2002,"Seems slightly hollow, and finishes with some coarse oak, but the fruit flavors of cherries and yellow-fleshed red plums are pretty and accented by a hint of smoke.

The delicate—almost Burgundian—cherries start off buried by oak and alcohol, but after some airing the flavors come together in a pleasant mélange of Bing cherries, maple syrup and caramel, accented on the finish by a touch of black pepper.
