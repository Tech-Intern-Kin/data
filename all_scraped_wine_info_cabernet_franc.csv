2033,N/A,"North Fork of Long Island, Long Island, New York, US",750 ml,Red, US,4/1/2001,"A Franc that shows off its herbal character in a big way, with aromas of fresh tarragon and basil. Fresh berry flavors provide a juicy counterpoint to the green herbs. A lighter style than many L.I. Cabernet Francs, but a successful one.",,,Gristina 1998 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),$22, New York,85, Long Island,Joe Czerwinski,,North Fork of Long Island,Not rated yet [Add Your Review],Cabernet Franc,1998,Gristina
2034,12.7%,"North Fork of Long Island, Long Island, New York, US",750 ml,Red, US,4/1/2001,"Sometimes Franc can have a lovely, alluringly floral bouquet; other times it can be downright vegetal and display green-bean characteristics. Unfortunately, this is an example of the latter. The wine has nice weight and texture, so if you don't mind your veggies in liquid form this might be more to your liking.",Estate Bottled,,Macari 1997 Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),$19, New York,80, Long Island,Joe Czerwinski,,North Fork of Long Island,Not rated yet [Add Your Review],Cabernet Franc,1997,Macari
2035,N/A,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",750 ml,Red, US,9/1/2000,"Tight, tannic and slightly stemmy, with dense chocolaty, blueberry fruit buried under a ton of tannin.

2036,13.5%,"Columbia Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",750 ml,Red, US,4/1/2000,"Heavily oaked, with plenty of toasty vanilla aromas. Features mentholly oak and a bright red-fruit character. Light in body, heavy on oak: not an entirely stylish combination—like a kid wearing his father's suit jacket.",Cold Creek Vineyard,,Chateau Ste.

2037,N/A,"North Fork of Long Island, Long Island, New York, US",750 ml,Red, US,12/1/1999,"Raspberry and chocolate flavors are accented by smoky, heavily toasted oak.

2038,13.1%,"Finger Lakes, Finger Lakes, New York, US",750 ml,Red, US,12/1/1999,"A complex, funky, smoky nose yields to bright red-raspberry fruit and taut acidity on the palate.

2039,N/A,"Yakima Valley, Columbia Valley, Washington, US",750 ml,Red, US,9/1/1999,"Typical Cab Franc floral nose—maybe even lilacs. Red cherry fruit and a pretty dose of oak complete the package.

2041,14.1%,"Napa Valley, Napa, California, US",750 ml,Red, US,6/1/1999,"A sound red wine from good fruit. Comes across fresh and ripe. Flavor is bold, but nose is muted and dusty. Well oaked, it's warm with vanilla nuances. American oak, maybe? Delivers a good overall package for a potentially tough wine to make on its  own. Quite dry and a bit narrow. Small production: 320 cases.",,,Chappellet 1996 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),$24, California,87, Napa,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Napa Valley,Not rated yet [Add Your Review],Cabernet Franc,1996,Chappellet
