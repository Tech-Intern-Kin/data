3261,N/A,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",750 ml,Red, Italy,7/1/2000,"A wonderful ready-to-drink Barolo with an amiable personality. Dark-cherry fruit is accented by a touch of orangey dryness; the body is amply weighty but not heavy. There's nothing here not to like, and once again, it's drinkable now. Belying the quality, this is a secondary wine from the sensational Bricco Roche vineyard.",Prapo,Moët Hennessy USA,Ceretto 1995 Prapo  (Barolo),$70, Piedmont,92,Barolo,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,,Not rated yet [Add Your Review],Nebbiolo,1995,Ceretto
3262,13%,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",750 ml,Red, Italy,7/1/2000,"At first this smells a bit gassy, and then earthy, raisiny aromas take over. Fairly light-looking in the glass, but quite soft and full on the tongue. Seems to be getting there in terms of maturity; it has cherry, cigar, chocolate and coffee flavors, and dissipating but drying tannins. Remains slightly raisiny at all points, and is never very flashy.",,The Winebow Group LLC,Cappellano 1994  Barolo,$40, Piedmont,85,Barolo,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,,Not rated yet [Add Your Review],Nebbiolo,1994,Cappellano
3263,N/A,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",750ML,Red, Italy,11/1/1999,"The purest of Piedmont fruit bombs, with a body that just won't quit. Full, youthful grapey aromas are followed by tannins so fine and dense they can only be described as beautiful. Heavy black-cherry fruit mingles with creamy oak. Fabulous complexity will only develop further with aging. A marvelous red to lay down in the cellar for at least five to ten years.",Fasêt,Moët Hennessy USA,Ceretto 1996 Fasêt  (Barbaresco),$70, Piedmont,93,Barbaresco,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,,Not rated yet [Add Your Review],Nebbiolo,1996,Ceretto
3264,N/A,"Barbaresco, Piedmont, Italy",750ML,Red, Italy,11/1/1999,"Laser-beam fruit defines this front-loaded heavyweight. Tons of coffee, tar and heavy black fruit create power in a bottle. Gets friendlier with time. Very fragrant and full-bodied, with mounds of cassis fruit and spicy toasted flavors. Needs a few years.",Bricco Asili,Moët Hennessy USA,Ceretto 1995 Bricco Asili  (Barbaresco),$105, Piedmont,90,Barbaresco,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,,Not rated yet [Add Your Review],Nebbiolo,1995,Ceretto
3265,N/A,"Valtellina Superiore, Lombardy, Italy",750 ml,Red, Italy,5/1/1999,"Light-colored wine, which belies big tannins and ripe, powerful fruit. Considerable palate weight, mixing tannins and dark fruit flavors into a brooding, long-lasting wine.
