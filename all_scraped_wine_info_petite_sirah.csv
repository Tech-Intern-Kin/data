785,N/A,"Livermore Valley, Central Coast, California, US",750 ml,Red, US,6/1/2007,"The flagship Petite Sirah from the winery's own vineyards in the Livermore Valley is the biggest and richest wine in the lineup. The nose is filled with intense blueberries, but also picks up hints of licorice, flowers and grilled meat, while the flavors feature lush fruit and spice.
